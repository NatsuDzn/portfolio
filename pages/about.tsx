                After high school, I studied at Hetic in Montreuil, where I
                started front-end development, and ui/ux design and back-end. In
                my free time I like to learn new things. During the weekend I
                like to read manga, code new things and hang out with friends.

                While I was at Hetic I had the chance to work after the end of
                my 1st year. I have started to work for ThingType where I
                learned about Angular. During my second and last year I worked
                at DessIA where I really dived in Angular. After my internship
                DessIA hired me full time.
